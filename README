== DESCRIPTION:

This IntelliJ IDEA plugin mimics the mark functionality of emacs. It adds the "Set Mark" command (under Tools) which will set the mark where the cursor is currently. It also provides the "Copy Mark Region" and "Cut Mark Region" commands which will either cut or copy the region from where the cursor is currently at to where the mark was last set.
